# Changelog

All notable changes to Stux.Cloud's `.github` repository are documented here.

## v1.0.1

### Fixed
- `generateMetrics.yml`'s `setup` job created the `metrics` branch by branching off `main`'s current commit, so
  it wasn't actually an orphan branch — it carried the whole repo history and file tree instead of starting
  empty. Now creates a true root commit (via the git empty-tree hash, no parents) and points `metrics` at that,
  so the branch only ever holds what the `gh-metrics/metrics` action commits to it. The already-created (wrong)
  `metrics` branch needs to be deleted so the next run recreates it correctly and regenerates the SVGs

## v1.0.0

### Added
- `VERSION.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`, and a `commit.sh`/`commit.bat` pair that reads the version from `VERSION.md` and tags the release accordingly
